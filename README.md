# ShortestPaths
Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest (least costly) route between nodes in an undirected graph.
And implementation of A*-search algorithm. The idea is to improve Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm by directing search
towards t and use Euclidean distance. 

Prerequisites:
Java
To have the two .txt files  with the Nodes and the Edges of Californias road network.

Usage:
First just use javac in California.java(where the main method is) and then run the programm and give two arguments(the starting node and the target node) 
For example:
1.javac California.java 
2.java California 0 10 (there are 21048 nodes)
